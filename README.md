# sdcard-cid

Shows CID of every sdcard.

## This project

I made this project to explain how you can:

 - develop with Qt for Android
 - implement a Qt plugin
 - call java code from C++ and Qml
 - build without QtCreator or Android Studio, using only command line tools

## Building

Just call

```
make android_armv7/run
```

and it will build, install and run this app in your Android device. See
`Makefile` for details.
